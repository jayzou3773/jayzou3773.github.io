# 🎓 About Me
I am a first-year master student with Master of Science in Computer Science in UC, San Diego <img src="../images/ucsd.png" width="16" style="vertical-align: right;"/>. Previously, I graduated with B.Eng in Software Engieering at <img src="../images/tongji.png" width="16" style="vertical-align: right;"/> Tongji University. During my undergraduate studies, I spent one semester as an exchange student at <img src="../images/ucb.png" width="16" style="vertical-align: right;"/> the University of California, Berkeley, and participated in the AI Summer School at <img src="../images/wlu.png" width="16" style="vertical-align: right;"/> Westlake University.

My research interests are AI Agent, LLM Post-training, AI for Software Engineering (AI4SE), and Human-Computer Interaction. Previously, I was a research assistant at the [SoftACE Lab, Tongji University](https://github.com/SoftACE-Lab), advised by Prof. Yan Liu. Moreover, I am also interested in the intersection of AI and transportation, as I previously studied Civil Engineering for one year at Tongji University.
